Motivation 
- This document outlines how to use the MATLAB scripts and simulations for test data related to the avionics battery pack 2025

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

How to store / access data processing / plotting scripts: 

1. Create a folder on your computer
2. Download all MATLAB files in the "MATLAB Data Processing" folder and extract them into the folder you have created on your own system
3. Download the contents of the "Excel Test Data" folder and put its contents with their respective sub folders onto the same folder that you have placed your MATLAB scripts. 
4. To use the data go into the files which start with "M_", which are the main files which all data works around

- If you have problems accessing the datafiles, replace the file paths in the scripts and try again.

File Names MATLAB Scripts: 
- "M_" : Main 
- "F_" : Function, used to preform function for "M_" scripts
- "P_" : Plotting files, used to plot data, works standalone 
- "R_" : Data Point Reduction function, Used to reduce datapoints to allow them to be used in other scripts
- "S_" : Sim Table data files, used as parameter data for simulations
